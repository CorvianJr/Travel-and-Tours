make sure to add a +(plus) button below the pricing in order 
to add additional pricings in case the package calls for more than 1 prices,
if more than 1 price, then create a duplicate row, but with different price
refer to one of the album images at the gc for reference

*/
/*
make a background selector for the packages
step 1: using japan as a reference(refer to img), display them onto 3 1:2 images(width:height)
step2: if one of the images is clicked, it gets highlighted and is to be set as a variable
step 3: once the save button is clicked, it will be used to create a background 
for the itinerary display(refer to admin.html)
